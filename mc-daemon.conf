# Configuration file for mc-daemon

#
# How To Use This File
# Create a new [section] for each server. The string in the square brackets
# will be the server name (used in logging, and notifications).
#

#
# Server Config Details
#
# Key       Description
#
# default - Valid options are "yes" and "no". (Defaults to yes) Specifies
#           whether this server should start when the daemon starts.
# user    - User to run this server as, recommended to never use root!
# group   - Group to run this server as, recommended to never use root!
# path    - Directory to run all commands from. Must be an absolute path.
# before  - A command that will be executed before the server is started (see
#           the note below).
# run     - Path to a script or binary file, that will run the server (this
#           should be the file that calls java).
# after   - A command that will be executed after the server is stopped (see the
#           note below).
# notify  - Path to a script or binary file, that the daemon may execute if it
#           needs to send you a notification (e.g. an error message if one of
#           your servers failed to start). The daemon will provide the message
#           as a single string argument.
#

#
# NOTE:
# Any setting that represents a command to be executed will pass the arguments
# literally, and will not parse for things like strings. i.e.
# start=program "this is an argument"
# will not pass "this is an argument" to program, but rather, "this" "is" "an"
# and "argument". Keep this in mind.
